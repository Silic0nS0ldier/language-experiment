# Language Experiment

Some machinations on a hypothetical language which may or may not be to my taste. The language concept within is likely a horror show, you've been warned.

A major focus is to keep keywords to the absolute minimum, relying on syntax and context to express meaning. Another major focus is eliminating potentially redundant source (namespaces for example are implied by folder structure with the project file defining the root).

While this language supports classes (wherein a given file is allowed only 1), standalone functions are also permitted (filename is basis for a namespace containing the functions).

Classes cannot be explicitly named, with the file name loaning the name (kabab case to pascal case).
